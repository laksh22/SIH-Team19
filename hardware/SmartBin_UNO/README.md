# Smart bin arduino code 
Built during Singapore India Hackathon 2019. A smart bin which communicates with [@RohanGautam/Waste-Management-App](https://github.com/RohanGautam/Waste-Management-App) via bluetooth serial communication.

## Components:
* Bluetooth module
* Ultrasonic distance sensors x2
* Weight sensor
* Micro servo [Note: you have to provide it with an external power supply, like another USB's power line, but it has to have the ground connection in the arduino]

## Schematic:
